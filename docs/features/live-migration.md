# Live Migration

## Introduction

The Live Migration feature allows [kubevirt](https://kubevirt.io) virtual machines to be [live migrated](https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/operations/live_migration/)
while keeping the established TCP connections alive, and preserving the VM IP configuration.
These two requirements provide seamless live-migration of a KubeVirt VM using OVN-Kubernetes
cluster default network.

## Motivation

kubevirt integration requires the ability to have live-migration functionality across the network with OVN-Kubernetes implemented at the pod's default network.

### User-Stories/Use-Cases

I, a kubevirt user, need to migrate one virtual machine with bridge binding without affecting different ones and have minimal
disruption.

### Non-Goals

This feature is not implemented at secondary networks, only primary networks will be live migratable.

## How to enable this feature on an OVN-Kubernetes cluster?

This feature is always enabled, it get triggered when a VM is annotated with 
`kubevirt.io/allow-pod-bridge-network-live-migration: ""` and use bridge binding. 

## Workflow Description

### Requirements

- KubeVirt >= v1.0.0
- DHCP aware guest image (fedora family is well tested, https://quay.io/organization/containerdisks)

### Example: live migrating a fedora guest image

Install KubeVirt following the guide [here](https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/operations/installation/)

Create a fedora virtual machine with the annotations `kubevirt.io/allow-pod-bridge-network-live-migration`:
```bash
cat <<'EOF' | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachine
metadata:
  name: fedora
spec:
  runStrategy: Always
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        # Allow KubeVirt VMs with bridge binding to be migratable
        # also ovn-k will not configure network at pod, delegate it to DHCP
        kubevirt.io/allow-pod-bridge-network-live-migration: ""
    spec:
      domain:
        devices:
          disks:
          - disk:
              bus: virtio
            name: containerdisk
          - disk:
              bus: virtio
            name: cloudinit
          rng: {}
        features:
          acpi: {}
          smm:
            enabled: true
        firmware:
          bootloader:
            efi:
              secureBoot: true
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: 1Gi
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 180
      volumes:
      - containerDisk:
          image: quay.io/containerdisks/fedora:38
        name: containerdisk
      - cloudInitNoCloud:
          networkData: |
            version: 2
            ethernets:
              eth0:
                dhcp4: true
          userData: |-
            #cloud-config
            # The default username is: fedora
            password: fedora
            chpasswd: { expire: False }
        name: cloudinit
EOF
```

After waiting for the VM to be ready - `kubectl wait vmi fedora --for=condition=Ready --timeout=5m` -
the VM status should be as shown below - i.e. `kubectl get vmi fedora`:

```bash
kubectl get vmi fedora
NAME     AGE     PHASE     IP            NODENAME      READY
fedora   9m42s   Running   10.244.2.26   ovn-worker3   True
```

Login and check that the VM has receive a proper address `virtctl console fedora`
```bash
[fedora@fedora ~]ip a
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 ::1/128 scope host
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1400 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 0a:58:0a:f4:02:1a brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    altname enp1s0
    inet 10.244.2.26/24 brd 10.244.2.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute eth0
       valid_lft 3412sec preferred_lft 3412sec
    inet6 fe80::32d2:10d4:f5ed:3064/64 scope link noprefixroute
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

Also we can check the neighbours cache to verify it later on
```bash
[fedora@fedora ~]arp -a
_gateway (169.254.1.1) at 0a:58:a9:fe:01:01 [ether] on eth0
```


Keep in mind the default gw is a link local address; that is because 
the live migration feature is implemented using ARP proxy.

The last route is needed since the link local address subnet is not bound to any interface, that
route is automatically created by dhcp client.

```bash
[fedora@fedora ~]ip route
default via 169.254.1.1 dev eth0 proto dhcp src 10.244.2.26 metric 100
10.244.2.0/24 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 10.244.2.26 metric 100
169.254.1.1 dev eth0 proto dhcp scope link src 10.244.2.26 metric 100
```

Then a live migration can be initialized with `virtctl migrate fedora` and wait
at the vmim resource
```bash
virtctl migrate fedora
VM fedora was scheduled to migrate
kubectl get vmim -A -o yaml
  status:
    migrationState:
      completed: true
```

After migration, the network configuration is the same - including the GW neighbor cache.
```bash
oc get vmi -A
NAMESPACE   NAME     AGE   PHASE     IP            NODENAME     READY
default     fedora   16m   Running   10.244.2.26   ovn-worker   True
[fedora@fedora ~]ip a
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 ::1/128 scope host
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1400 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 0a:58:0a:f4:02:1a brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    altname enp1s0
    inet 10.244.2.26/24 brd 10.244.2.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute eth0
       valid_lft 2397sec preferred_lft 2397sec
    inet6 fe80::32d2:10d4:f5ed:3064/64 scope link noprefixroute
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
[fedora@fedora ~]arp -a
_gateway (169.254.1.1) at 0a:58:a9:fe:01:01 [ether] on eth0
```

### Configuring dns server
By default the DHCP server at ovn-kuberntes will configure the kubernetes
default dns service `kube-system/kube-dns` as the name server. This can be
overriden with the following command line options:
- dns-service-namespace
- dns-service-name


### Configuring dual stack guest images
For dual stack, ovn-kubernetes is configuring the IPv6 address to guest VMs using
DHCPv6, but the IPv6 default gateway has to be configured manually.
Since this address is the same - `fe80::1` - the virtual machine configuration
is stable. 

Both the ipv4 and ipv6 configurations have to be activated.

NOTE: The IPv6 autoconf/SLAAC is not supported at ovn-k live-migration


For fedora cloud-init can be used to activate dual stack:
```yaml
 - cloudInitNoCloud:
     networkData: |
       version: 2
       ethernets:
         eth0:
           dhcp4: true
           dhcp6: true
     userData: |-
       #cloud-config
       # The default username is: fedora
       password: fedora
       chpasswd: { expire: False }
       runcmd:
         - nmcli c m "cloud-init eth0" ipv6.method dhcp
         - nmcli c m "cloud-init eth0" +ipv6.routes "fe80::1"
         - nmcli c m "cloud-init eth0" +ipv6.routes "::/0 fe80::1"
         - nmcli c reload "cloud-init eth0"
```

For fedora coreos this can be configured with using the following
ignition yaml:

```yaml
variant: fcos
version: 1.4.0
storage:
  files:
    - path: /etc/nmstate/001-dual-stack-dhcp.yml
      contents:
        inline: |
          interfaces:
          - name: enp1s0
            type: ethernet
            state: up
            ipv4:
              enabled: true
              dhcp: true
            ipv6:
              enabled: true
              dhcp: true
              autoconf: false
    - path: /etc/nmstate/002-dual-sack-ipv6-gw.yml
      contents:
        inline: |
          routes:
            config:
            - destination: ::/0
              next-hop-interface: enp1s0
              next-hop-address: fe80::1
```

## Implementation Details

### Kubevirt Introduction

At kubevirt every VM is executed inside a "virt-launcher" pod; how the "virt-launcher" pod net interface is "bound" to the VM is specified by the network binding at the VM spec, ovn-kubernetes support live migration of the KubeVirt network bridge binding. 

The KubeVirt bridge binding adds  a bridge and a tap device and connects the existing pod interface as a port of the aforementioned bridge. When IPAM is configured on the pod interface, a DHCP server is started to advertise the pod's IP to DHCP aware VMs.

KubeVirt doesn't replace anything. It adds a bridge and a tap device, and connects the existing pod interface as a port of the aforementioned bridge.

Benefit of the bridge binding is that is able to expose the pod IP to the VM as expected by most users also pod network bridge binding live migration is implemented by ovn-kubernetes by doing the following:
- Do IP assignemnt with ovn-k but skip the CNI part that configure it at pod's netns veth.
- Do not expect the IP to be on the pod netns.
- Add the ability at ovn-k controllers to migrate pod's IP from node to node.

### OVN-Kubernetes Implementation Details

To implement live migration ovn-kubernetes do the following:
- Send DHCP replies advertising the allocated IP address to the guest VM (via OVN-Kubernetes DHCP options configured for the logical switch ports).
- A point to point routing is used so one node's subnet IP can be routed from different node
- The VM's gateway IP and MAC are independent of the node they are running on using proxy arp
- Send GARPs and unsolicited NAs after live migration to fix neighbors tables and point to gw mac

**Point to point routing:**

When the VM is running at a node that does not "own" it's IP address - e.g. after a live migration - 
after a live migration, do point to point routing with a policy for non 
interconnect and a cluster wide static route for interconnected zones, it will
route outbound traffic and a static route to route inboud.
By doing this, the VM can live migrate to different node and keep previous 
addresses (IP / MAC), thus preserving n/s and e/w communication, and ensuring traffic
goes over the node where the VM is running. The latter reduces inter node communication.

If the VM is going back to the node that "owns" the ip, those static routes and 
policies should be reconciled (deleted).

└───────────────────────────┘   └────────────────────────────┘ 
- static route: ingress traffic to VM's IP via VM's node port
- policy: egress n/s traffic from VM's IP via gateway router ip
```

When ovn-kubernetes is deployed with multiple ovn zones interconected 
an extra static route is added to the local zone (zone where vm is running) to
route egress n/s traffic to the gw router. Note that for interconnect the
previous policy is not needed, at remote zones a static route is address to 
enroute VM egress traffic over the transit switch port address.

If the transit switch port address is 10.64.0.3 and gw router is 10.64.0.2, 
those below are the static route added to the topology when running with 
multiple zones:

└───────────────────────────┘
```


**Nodes logical switch ports:**

To have a consistent gateway at VMs (keep ip and mac after live migration) 
the "arp_proxy" feature is used and it need to be activated at 
the logical switch port of type router connects node's logical switch to 
ovn_cluster_router logical router.

The "arp_proxy" LSP option will include the MAC to answer ARPs with, and the
link local ipv4 and ipv6 to answer for and the cluster wide pod CIDR to answer
to pod subnets when the node switch do not have the live migrated ip. The
flows from arp_proxy has less priority than the ones from the node logical 
switch so ARP flows are not overriden.

```

**VMs logical switch ports:**

The logical switch port for new VMs will use ovn-k ipam to reserve an IP address,
and when live-migrating the VM, the LSP address will be re-used.

CNI must avoid setting the IP address on the migration destination pod, but ovn-k controllers should 
preserve the IP allocation, that is done when ovn-k detects that the pod is
live migratable.

Also the DHCP options will be configured to deliver the address to the VMs

└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Virt-launcher pod address:**
The CNI will not set an address at virt-launcher pod netns, that address is
assigned to the VM with the DHCP options from the LSP, this allows to use 
kubevirt bridge binding with pod networking and still do live migration.

#### IPAM

The point to point routing feature allows an address to be running at a node different from
the one "owning" the subnet the address is coming from. This will happen
after VM live migration.

One scenario for live migration is to shut down the node the VMs were migrated
from, this means that the IPAM node subnet should go back to the pool but since
the migrated VMs contains IPs from it those IPs should reserved in case the 
subnet is assigned to a new node.

On that case before assigning the subnet to the node the VMs ips need to be 
reserved so they don't get assigned to new pods

Another scenario is ovn-kubernetes pods restarting after live migration, on 
that case ovnkube-master should discover to what IP pool the VM belongs.


#### Detecting migratable VMs and changing point to point routes

To detect that a pod is migratable KubevirtVm the annotation `kubevirt.io/allow-pod-bridge-network-live-migration`
has to be present and also the label `vm.kubevirt.io/name=vm1`, on that case
the point to point routes will be created after live migration and also a 
DHCPOptions will be configured to serve the ip configuration to the VM

During live migration there are two virt-launcher pods with different names for the same VM (source and target). The ovn-k pod controller uses `CreationTimestamp` and `kubevirt.io/vm=vm1`
to differentiate between them; it then watches the target pod `kubevirt.io/nodeName` and `kubevirt.io/migration-target-start-timestamp` annotation and label, with the following intent:
- The `kubevirt.io/nodeName` is set after the VM finishes live migrating or when it becomes ready.
- The `kubevirt.io/migration-target-start-timestamp` is set when live migration has not finished but migration-target pod is ready to receive traffic (this happens at post-copy live migration, where migration is taking too long).

The point to point routing cleanup (remove of static routes and policies) will be done at this cases:
- VM is deleted, all the routing related to the VM is removed at all the ovn zones.
- VM is live migrated back to the node that owns its IP, all the routing related to the VM is removed at all the ovn zones.
- ovn-kubernetes controllers are restarted, stale routing is removed.

**Advertising neighbors:**
To improve the connectivity after live migration  ovn-k sends GARPs and unsolicited NAs to pods at node owning the subnet and 
to VM at running at migration target node.

To understand it first we have to check how the neighbors tables looks before live migration at vm and pods running at the same
node.

Let's first look at the logical switch ports of one vm and one pod running at the same node and their neighbors tables

```text
    ┌───────────────────────────────┐
    │     logical switch node1      │
    │       (10.244.0.0/24)         │
    └───────────────────────────────┘ 
┌──────────────────────┐  │     │   ┌──────────────────────┐      
│ lsp ns-virt-launcher1│──┘     └───│ lsp pod1             │     
│ address:             │            │ address:             │    
│  0a:58:0a:f4:00:01   │            │  0a:58:0a:f4:00:02   │
│  10.244.0.8          │            │  10.244.0.9          │
└──────────────────────┘            └──────────────────────┘
neighbors table vm:
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ 10.244.0.9 -> 0a:58:0a:f4:00:02 │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
neighbors table pod1:
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ 10.244.0.8 -> 0a:58:0a:f4:00:01 │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

Now after live migration from node1 to node2 the situation is the following:


```text
    ┌────────────────────────┐ ┌────────────────────────┐
    │logical switch node2    │ │logic switch node1      │ 
    │   (10.244.1.0/24)      │ │   (10.244.0.0/24)      │
    └────────────────────────┘ └────────────────────────┘ 
┌──────────────────────┐  │     │   ┌──────────────────────┐      
│ lsp ns-virt-launcher1│──┘     └───│ lsp pod1             │     
│ address:             │            │ address:             │    
│  0a:58:0a:f4:00:01   │            │  0a:58:0a:f4:00:02   │
│  10.244.0.8          │            │  10.244.0.9          │
└──────────────────────┘            └──────────────────────┘
neighbors table vm:
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ 10.244.0.9 -> 0a:58:0a:f4:00:02 │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
neighbors table pod1:
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ 10.244.0.8 -> 0a:58:0a:f4:00:01 │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

Now the neighbors tables are incorrect since none of those mac addresses are 
are part of the logical switches, after some time or traffic neighbors cache
get invalidated and updated so they will point to the arp_proxy mac `0a:58:0a:f3:00:00`, problem
is that it may take too much time and connections will be broken.

To improve the situation ovn-k sends the following GARPs and unsolicited NA taking
into account that the arp proxy mac is `0a:58:0a:f3:00:00`:

At node1 broadcast vm's IP should use arp proxy mac
- `GARP(10.244.0.8 -> 0a:58:0a:f3:00:00, broadcast mac)`
- one per migrated VM

At node2 advertise to VM that pod's from the same subnet should go over proxy_arp:
- `GARP(10.244.0.9 -> 0a:58:0a:f3:00:00, vm mac(0a:58:0a:f4:00:01))`
- one per pod on the same subnet (in this example, only for pod1).

Also ovn-k removes the mac address from the VM's old LSP after live migration
to be sure that generated ARP's from pods are not answered back with VM's mac
instead of arp proxy.

## Future Items

- Implement single stack IPv6

## Known Limitations

- Only KubeVirt VMs with bridge binding pod network are supported
- Single stack IPv6 is not supported
- DualSack does not configure routes for IPv6 over DHCP/autoconf
- SRIOV is not supported
