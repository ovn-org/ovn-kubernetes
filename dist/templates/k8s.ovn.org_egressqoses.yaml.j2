          EgressQoS is a CRD that allows the user to define a DSCP value
          for pods egress traffic on its namespace to specified CIDRs.
          Traffic from these pods will be checked against each EgressQoSRule in
          the namespace's EgressQoS, and if there is a match the traffic is marked
          with the relevant DSCP value.
