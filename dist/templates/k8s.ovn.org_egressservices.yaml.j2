          EgressService is a CRD that allows the user to request that the source
          IP of egress packets originating from all of the pods that are endpoints
          of the corresponding LoadBalancer Service would be its ingress IP.
          In addition, it allows the user to request that egress packets originating from
          all of the pods that are endpoints of the LoadBalancer service would use a different
          network than the main one.

              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.

                        A label selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and an operator that
                        relates the key and values.

                  When `LoadBalancerIP` the source IP is set to its LoadBalancer ingress IP.
                  When `Network` the source IP is set according to the interface of the Network,
                  leveraging the masquerade rules that are already in place.
                  Typically these rules specify SNAT to the IP of the outgoing interface,
                  which means the packet will typically leave with the IP of the node.
