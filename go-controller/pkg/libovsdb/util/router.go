// This logic works under the assumption that we have all other paths covered via routes that exist with higher precedence prefix match
// On first look it may seem like we are sending out traffic that doesn't "fit/match" other routes which is true, but the intent is that
// if we don't know where to send the traffic within the cluster, then we make it leave the cluster (we have a flow on br-ex that protects us and
// drops it if its not supposed to be going outside). This is needed when IC=true to ensure traffic from the other node arriving at this remote node
// does not get dropped. This removes the need for per-pod LRSR for primaryEIP and secondaryEIP && ESVC add a per-pod LRP on each egressNode to
// override this LRSR and send it to it's management port. NOTE: Handle changes around this logic with care. This is being added intentionally.
// (TODO: FIXME): With this route, we are officially breaking support for IC with zones that have multiple-nodes
// NOTE: This route is exactly the same as what is added by pod-live-migration feature and we keep the route exactly
// same across the 3 features so that if the route already exists on the node, this is just a no-op
